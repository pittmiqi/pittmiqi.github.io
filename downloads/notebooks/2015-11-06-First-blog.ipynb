    "This is the first post for my website. I decided to put the guides for how to set up a static website using [Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) based [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/) framework and freely host it in [Github](https://github.com/).\n",
    "This post was all written in [ipython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) or [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) which are also Python based tools and it is the primary reason for me to choose pelican instead of other static site generators, such as Ruby based [Jekyll](https://www.staticgen.com/) or Javascript based [Hexo](https://www.staticgen.com/), etc. \n",
    "1. Register an account in Github and and setup a repository called \"*yourname*.github.io\" (replace *yourname* with your github username) where we will use to upload the content fo website, see [this for detail](https://pages.github.com/). \n",
    "2. Install pelican, follow [this guide](docs.getpelican.com), create content in [markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), upload the output you generated to <b>1</b>, then done!\n",
    "3. If you want to change the looks for the site, check out [pelican-themes](http://www.pelicanthemes.com/) and its Github [repository](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes). The current theme for this site is adapted from [lazystrap](https://github.com/lazycoder-ru/lazystrap).\n",
    "4. Want to use ipython notebook in pelican? see [Jake VanderPlas' post](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/05/07/migrating-from-octopress-to-pelican/) and checkout [source file at Github](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonicPerambulations). Use the settings in his [pelicanconf.py](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonicPerambulations/blob/master/pelicanconf.py) file<p>\n",
    "5. Other tips:\n",
    "  - Google Analytics, [register here](https://www.google.com/analytics/)\n",
    "  - DISQUS for comments, [register here](https://disqus.com/)\n",
    "  - I used the command \"pelican content\" to generate the output, and I have to move settings in publishconf.py to pelicanconf.py     in order to get GOOGLE_ANALYTICS and DISQUS_SITENAME rendered.  \n",
    "  - Make sure to set value for SITEURL, and set RELATIVE_URLS = Ture for testing and False for production.\n",
