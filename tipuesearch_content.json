The content in the site aims for a concise style of writing and will leverage others exisiting work as much as possible. In most of posts, what you will see will be a bunch of hyperlinks that lead to various valuable resources. Essentially my work is to organize them in a logical fashion and provide a high level guide that help you reach the learning goal. So in the first post, I put a guide for how to set up a static website using Python based Pelican framework and freely host it in Github . This post was all written in ipython notebook or jupyter . The ease of integration of ipython notebook to the web content is the primary reason for me to choose Pelican over other static site generators, such as Ruby based Jekyll or Javascript based Hexo , etc. Path Register an account in Github and and setup a repository called \" yourname .github.io\" (replace yourname with your github username) where we will upload the content of website, see this for detail . Install pelican, follow this guide , create content in markdown language , upload the output you generated to 1 , then done! If you want to change the looks for the site, check out pelican-themes and its Github repository . The current theme for this site is adapted from lazystrap . Want to use ipython notebook in pelican? See Jake VanderPlas' post and checkout source file at Github . Use the settings in his pelicanconf.py file Tips: Google Analytics, register here DISQUS for comments, register here I used the command \"pelican content\" to generate the output, and I have to move settings in publishconf.py to pelicanconf.py in order to get GOOGLE_ANALYTICS and DISQUS_SITENAME rendered. Make sure to set value for SITEURL, and set RELATIVE_URLS = Ture for testing and False for production. To hide the python code in ipython notebook, just add this css code in the markdown file < style type = \"text/css\" > .input_prompt , .input_area , .output_prompt { display : none !important ; } </ style > This is the minimal guide for setting up a static website using Python.
