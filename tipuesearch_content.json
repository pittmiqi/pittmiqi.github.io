{"pages":[{"title":"How to setup website with Python","tags":"misc","text":".input_prompt, .input_area, .output_prompt { display:none !important; } The purpose of this site is to share the experience, guides and pathes of learning. The content in the site is in a concise fashion and will leverage others exisiting work as much as possible. So in the first post, I put a guide for how to set up a static website using [Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) based [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/) framework and freely host it in [Github](https://github.com/). This post was all written in [ipython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) or [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) which are also Python based tools and it is the primary reason for me to choose pelican instead of other static site generators, such as Ruby based [Jekyll](https://www.staticgen.com/) or Javascript based [Hexo](https://www.staticgen.com/), etc. Register an account in Github and and setup a repository called \" yourname .github.io\" (replace yourname with your github username) where we will use to upload the content fo website, see this for detail . Install pelican, follow this guide , create content in markdown language , upload the output you generated to 1 , then done! If you want to change the looks for the site, check out pelican-themes and its Github repository . The current theme for this site is adapted from lazystrap . Want to use ipython notebook in pelican? see Jake VanderPlas' post and checkout source file at Github . Use the settings in his pelicanconf.py file Other tips: Google Analytics, register here DISQUS for comments, register here I used the command \"pelican content\" to generate the output, and I have to move settings in publishconf.py to pelicanconf.py in order to get GOOGLE_ANALYTICS and DISQUS_SITENAME rendered. Make sure to set value for SITEURL, and set RELATIVE_URLS = Ture for testing and False for production. To hide the python code in ipython notebook, just add this css code in the markdown file < style type = \"text/css\" > .input_prompt , .input_area , .output_prompt { display : none !important ; } </ style > This is the minimal guide for setting up a static website using Python.
